# PLASU CLEARANCE

## DESCRIPTION OF THE APP
PLASUCLEARANCE is an amazing clearance app that is created to ease the clearance process of final year students in PLASU. The app allows the administrator to input student record and the student is cleared based on the information supplied by the administrator. The admin is given a secret pin to access the app. The user interface of the app is clean, nice and intuitive to use.

## DESCRIPTION OF CODE BASE
The code base is structured with a total number of 5 folders which I used to structure my app in a very clean and orderlly manner. The first folder is named "resources" and it contains a file that houses the authentication methods used in the app. The next folder is called "screens" which contains all the screen files in the app. The next folder is called "styles" which contains the styling of the app. The next folder is called "utils" and it houses reuseable snackbar message. The next folder is named widgets and it contains all the extracted widgets in the app.

## HOW TO USE THE APP
After launching the app the first screen that comes up is the splash screen and it displays the logo of the app for 3 seconds. Then it moves to a screen where it asks if the user is an adminor a graduating student. If the user clicks admin; it will take them to a page where they are required to fill in the students record and submit. If the user on the otherhand clicks the option of graduating student; they will be required to login with their email and matric number and if the student record have been uploaded, the student will be allowed acces to their dashboard and the student will be cleared accordingly based on the records uploaded by the admin for that particular student.
